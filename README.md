# student-cheating-detection-by-evaluating-grades-deep-learning
In this project, we aimed to develop a model for detecting cheating in student exams using deep learning techniques. We used a dataset that included the grades of students in different sections of the exam as features and their labels as normal or cheating. Our dataset was smaller than the other referenced studies but was still effective in our model development.

We developed a model architecture using LSTM layers with dropout and dense layers for binary classification. We used the binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer for model compilation. We trained and validated our model and obtained a training accuracy of 90% and a validation accuracy of 92%. Our model outperformed the referenced studies that used CNN and RNN models and achieved higher accuracy with our smaller dataset.

our model successfully detected cheating in student exams with a high degree of accuracy. This project highlights the potential of deep learning techniques for detecting academic dishonesty and can contribute to developing more effective methods for ensuring academic integrity. However, it is important to note that cheating detection is a complex and multifaceted issue, and further research is needed to fully address this problem.
